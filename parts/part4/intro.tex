% \part{Evaluation of Sea for Big Data Neuroimaging}
% \section*{Preface}

% Sea enables researchers to get on-the-fly automated data-management for their
% applications running in HPC environments. We have previously seen the speedups that
% can be obtained with a synthetic data-intensive pipeline, but it remains to be evaluated
% against standard neuroimaging pipelines. Furthermore, we have not yet evaluated how see affects
% the four axes of neuroimaging pipelines, namely: 1) ease-of-use, 2) reproducibility,
% 3) portability and 4) parallelism.

% In the following two chapters, we will analyze how using Sea alongside standard neuroimaging
% pipelines alters the four axes and how Sea affects the performance of standard neuroimaging pipelines.
% The first chapter will be a breakdown of each axis and how Sea meets the requirements, concluding
% on a discussion on which how Sea can be improved to further meet the requirements. The second chapter
% will consist of a manuscript on a performance analysis of Sea used alongside standard fMRI pipelines
% preprocessing representative datasets. The performance analysis experiments are executed in both a controlled and
% real HPC environment.
