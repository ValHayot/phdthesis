\chapter{Evaluation of Sea as a neuroimaging add-on}

We previously stated that tools for neuroimaging and scientific computing can be broken down into four different
characteristics: 1) ease-of-use, 2) reproducibility,
3) portability, and 4) parallelism. While we have discussed the performance benefits of Sea, we have not yet analysed how
the use of Sea can alter the characteristics that the underlying tools running against Sea aim to preserve. In this chapter,
we will investigate how Sea affects these characteristics and what can be improved to ensure the needs of domain scientists,
with respect to these characteristics, are met.


\section{Ease-of-use}
Commands submitted to the underlying tool are not modified by Sea, and thus, the ease-of-use of the underlying application is 
not affected by Sea. However, to effectively use Sea, a configuration parameter must be provided. This configuration file
must contain details such as the largest file size produced by the pipeline, or at least an estimate of the maximum amount of space
that would be required at any given time.
