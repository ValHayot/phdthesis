  abstract = {Despite substantial recent progress, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms underlying complex brain function and cognition remains incomplete. Network neuroscience proposes to tackle these enduring challenges. Approaching brain structure and function from an explicitly integrative perspective, network neuroscience pursues new ways to map, record, analyze and model the elements and interactions of neurobiological systems. Two parallel trends drive the approach: the availability of new empirical tools to create comprehensive maps and record dynamic patterns among molecules, neurons, brain areas and social systems; and the theoretical framework and computational tools of modern network science. The convergence of empirical and computational advances opens new frontiers of scientific inquiry, including network dynamics, manipulation and control of brain networks, and integration of network processes across spatiotemporal domains. We review emerging trends in network neuroscience and attempt to chart a path toward a better understanding of the brain as a multiscale networked system.},

  abstract  = {A derivation is given of the effect of a time‐dependent magnetic field gradient on the spin‐echo experiment, particularly in the presence of spin diffusion. There are several reasons for preferring certain kinds of time‐dependent magnetic field gradients to the more usual steady gradient. If the gradient is reduced during the rf pulses, H1 need not be particularly large; if the gradient is small at the time of the echo, the echo will be broad and its amplitude easy to measure. Both of these relaxations of restrictions on the measurement of diffusion coefficients by the spin‐echo technique serve to extend its range of applicability. Furthermore, a pulsed gradient can be recommended when it is critical to define the precise time period over which diffusion is being measured.The theoretical expression derived has been verified experimentally for several choices of time dependent magnetic field gradient. An apparatus is described suitable for the production of pulsed gradients with amplitudes as large as 100 ...},

  author   = {Jeurissen, Ben and Descoteaux, Maxime and Mori, Susumu and
              Leemans, Alexander},
  abstract = {The ability of fiber tractography to delineate non-invasively the
              white matter fiber pathways of the brain raises possibilities for
              clinical applications and offers enormous potential for
              neuroscience. In the last decade, fiber tracking has become the
              method of choice to investigate quantitative MRI parameters in
              specific bundles of white matter. For neurosurgeons, it is
              quickly becoming an invaluable tool for the planning of surgery,
              allowing for visualization and localization of important white
              matter pathways before and even during surgery. Fiber tracking
              has also claimed a central role in the field of ``connectomics,''
              a technique that builds and studies comprehensive maps of the
              complex network of connections within the brain, and to which
              significant resources have been allocated worldwide. Despite its
              unique abilities and exciting applications, fiber tracking is not
              without controversy, in particular when it comes to its
              interpretation. As neuroscientists are eager to study the brain's
              connectivity, the quantification of tractography-derived
              ``connection strengths'' between distant brain regions is
              becoming increasingly popular. However, this practice is often
              frowned upon by fiber-tracking experts. In light of this
              controversy, this paper provides an overview of the key concepts
              of tractography, the technical considerations at play, and the
              different types of tractography algorithm, as well as the common
              misconceptions and mistakes that surround them. We also highlight
              the ongoing challenges related to fiber tracking. While recent
              methodological developments have vastly increased the biological
              accuracy of fiber tractograms, one should be aware that, even
              with state-of-the-art techniques, many issues that severely bias
              the resulting structural ``connectomes'' remain unresolved.},

              intravoxel fiber populations within regions of complex white
              matter architecture. This information can be used for fiber
              tracking; however, diffusion MR is susceptible to noise and
              multiple other sources of uncertainty affecting the measured
              orientation of fiber bundles. The proposed residual bootstrap
              method utilizes a spherical harmonic representation for high
              angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data in order to
              estimate the uncertainty in multimodal q-ball reconstructions.
              The accuracy of the q-ball residual bootstrap technique was
              examined through simulation. The residual bootstrap method was
              then used in combination with q-ball imaging to construct a
              probabilistic streamline fiber tracking algorithm. The residual
              bootstrap q-ball fiber tracking algorithm is capable of following
              the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum through regions of
              crossing white matter tracts in the centrum semiovale. This fiber
              tracking algorithm is an improvement upon prior diffusion tensor
              methods and the q-ball data can be acquired in a clinically
              feasible time frame.},

              software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic
              resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of
              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative
              visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in
              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed
              by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of
              contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in
              five countries and three continents, which is still growing.},
